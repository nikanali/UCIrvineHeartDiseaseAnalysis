# UCIrvineHeartDiseaseAnalysis
This analysis uses the Heart Disease dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository to address Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) objectives.

Overview

Heart disease is the second leading cause of death in Canada. Additionally, worldwide heart disease is one of the most relevant topics. It is a topic of interest in many fields and people of different backgrounds including many doctors and researchers. Unfortunately, there is a lot of vagueness regarding the factors that directly affect or are related to heart diseases. This report will dive deeper into the topic to seek some clarification and answer the following 4 goal questions.

Goals

Is age a significant contributing factor to cholesterol levels?

Is resting blood pressure needed to accurately predict and draw conclusions about a patient's cholesterol levels?

Is a patient's cholesterol levels a significant enough indicator of the possibility of heart disease?

Are there any indicators significantly contributing to a patient's low blood pressure over healthy?

Description

Heart disease remains a significant health challenge in Canada and globally, driven by lifestyle changes and modernization. Contributing factors include insufficient exercise, unhealthy diets, and increasing stress levels. Efforts to understand and address heart disease focus on prevention, early detection, and treatment by identifying key predictive factors and indicators. This report aims to explore these hypothesized factors to better understand their role in heart disease among Canadians and worldwide populations.

This topic is well-documented, providing a solid foundation for further exploration based on established findings. According to the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System, heart disease affects approximately 2.6 million Canadian adults aged 20 and older, with men at higher risk and often diagnosed earlier than women. Adults with heart disease face nearly three times the mortality risk compared to those without, with even higher risks for individuals who have experienced heart attacks or heart failure. However, from 2000 to 2018, new diagnoses and mortality rates have declined, reflecting advancements in prevention and treatment. Modifiable risk factors, including smoking, physical inactivity, poor diet, and excessive alcohol consumption, along with early management of conditions such as high blood pressure, and diabetes, can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2022).
